name: 'mimics1.5a: Michigan Microwave Scattering Model'
description: MIMICS is meant to simulate the radar backscatter from a forested region
  at frequencies in the P, L, and C bands. There are many parameters that describe
  the soil, the trunks, the branches and the foliage. The code using vector radiative
  transfer with PDFs of the canopy constituents to produce estimates of the co- and
  cross-polarized backscattered powers. See the file &#34;mimics.pdf&#34; in the code
  directory for a more complete description.
